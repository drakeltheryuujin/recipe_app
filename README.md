## KitchenGO!

KitchenGO! is a social platform for foodies to share and search for their favorite recipes. It includes an easy-to-use functionality for users to create a shopping list based on ingredients they'll need for a given recipe. They can then search for local markets that carry those particular ingredients to speed up the entire food prep process. Users can also rate, review and bookmark recipes. 

KitchenGO! is built with Ruby on Rails and utilizes HTTParty for integration with the [Supermarket API](http://www.supermarketapi.com/Default.aspx).
